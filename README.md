# moral-test
WORK IN PROGRESS. Python script to enter a statement and receive a moral rating of whether the statement is considered positive/negative. 

The script currently uses an excel data file with a list of words and their weighting, excel data file created by a group of university students through studies conducted of whether a word is considered "good" or "bad" by members surveyed. This excel data file is used (for now) as the source of the calculations. It can be switched out later to a dynamic database.
- the higher the weighting the more "positive" the statement is deemed


The goal is to search various sources of info (twitter, news sites, google, bing, yahoo) and make note of how many "bad" words and "good" words on the internet are associated with a particular statement that user is testing and then relay a rating back to the user indicating if the statement they tested was "good" or "bad".
